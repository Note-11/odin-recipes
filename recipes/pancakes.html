    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fluffy homemade pancakes perfect for a delicious breakfast or brunch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; some lumps are okay.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream. Enjoy!</li>
